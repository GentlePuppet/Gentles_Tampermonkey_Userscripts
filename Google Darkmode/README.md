# Gentle's GoogleNightThemeUserscript
A Tampermonkey Userscript I made and use to make Google Darker.

If I notice any changes to google or weirdness I'll fix it when I have the time.
When I update the script you'll get an auto update notification.

Something's are unchanged because google uses !important on a few elements disallowing me to override them. But for the most part everything works fine.

As long as you have a userscript extension like Tampermonkey or Greasemonkey then clicking the link below will install the script for you.
