# Gentle's GoogleNightThemeUserscript
A Tampermonkey Userscript I made and use to make Google Darker.

If I notice any changes to google or weirdness I'll fix it when I have the time.
When I update the script you'll get an auto update notification.

Something's are unchanged because google uses !important on a few elements disallowing me to override them. But for the most part everything works fine.

As long as you have a userscript extension like Tampermonkey or Greasemonkey then clicking the link below will install the script for you.
* [Install Darkmode Google](https://github.com/GentlePuppet/Gentles_Tampermonkey_Userscripts/raw/main/Google%20Darkmode/Google%20Nightmode.user.js)

### Don't have a userscript extension?
* [Get Tampermonkey for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en)
* [Get Tampermonkey for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/)
