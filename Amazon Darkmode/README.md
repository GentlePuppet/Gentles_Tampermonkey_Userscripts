## Description:
This is a simple Userscript that makes amazon darkmoded. It can be a bit buggy here and there but I try to updaate it when needed. It works for the most part.

As long as you have a userscript extension like Tampermonkey or Greasemonkey then clicking the link below will install the script for you.
