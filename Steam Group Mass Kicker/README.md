# Gentle's Steam Group Mass Kicker Script
A Tampermonkey Userscript I made to allow you to select multiple users in a steam group to kick in rapid succession, instead of manually kicking one by one.

When I update the script you'll get an auto update notification.

As long as you have a userscript extension like Tampermonkey or Greasemonkey then clicking the link below will install the script for you.
