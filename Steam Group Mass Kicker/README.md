# Gentle's Steam Group Mass Kicker Script
A Tampermonkey Userscript I made to allow you to select multiple users in a steam group to kick in rapid succession, instead of manually kicking one by one.

When I update the script you'll get an auto update notification.

Select users you want to click by checking the tick box next to the kick button. 

Once you select all the users you want to kick click the verify button at the top.
