# Gentle's Warframe Market Custom Whisper Message

This is a userscript that automatically copies a better message to your clipboard when clicking the BUY/SELL button on warframe market.
I hated that the default copy/paste message doesn't link the item you are trading for, so I made my own copy/paste message that actually does.

Default Buy Message: 
> /w Username Hello, I want to buy: Harrow Prime Chassis Blueprint for 4 platinum. (warframe.market)

Custom Buy Message:
> /w Username Hello, I'd like to trade 4:platinum: for [Harrow Prime Chassis] Blueprint. (warframe.market)

<br><br>
Default Sell Message: 
> /w Username Hi! I want to sell: "Harrow Prime Chassis Blueprint" for 4 platinum. (warframe.market)

Custom Sell Message:
> /w Username Hello, I'd like to sell a [Harrow Prime Chassis] Blueprint for 4:platinum: (warframe.market)**
